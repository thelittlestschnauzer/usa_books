# Specifications for the CLI Assessment

Specs:
- [x] Have a CLI for interfacing with the application

    My CLI gem is executable from ./bin/usa_books once the user has installed the gem. The user is then welcomed to the program and presented with the list of the top ten best sellers from USA Today. The user is then asked to choose one of the books with the corresponding number for a brief summary of the book, or the user can type 'exit' to end the program or 'list' for the list again.


- [x] Pull data from an external source

    In the usa_books gem the information is scraped from USA Today Bestsellers List page.

- [x] Implement both list and detail views

    The user first is presented with the list of books which is scraped from USA Today and then once prompted by the user, a brief summary of the book is presented which is all scraped from USA Today Bestseller page.
